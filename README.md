# ByteLocker

ByteLocker is a C++ project aimed at creating a custom file encryption tool, inspired by BitLocker. The primary goal of ByteLocker is to provide secure file encryption and decryption using a user-defined password. This tool is designed to be cross-platform, working on both Windows and Ubuntu systems.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES).
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt files using the same password used for encryption.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work on both Windows and Ubuntu systems.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use. (Or maybe a GUI later)
