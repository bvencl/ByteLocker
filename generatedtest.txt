Long single line to test buffer limits:
This is a very long line of text that is intended to test the buffer limits of the encryption program. It should be long enough to exceed any reasonable buffer size used in typical encryption algorithms and thus help identify any issues with handling long input lines. The line continues with more and more text just to make sure it's really long enough to potentially cause problems if the buffer size is not handled properly by the encryption program. This is just a test, but it's a very important one to ensure the robustness of the software.

End of file test.
